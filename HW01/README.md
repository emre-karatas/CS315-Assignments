# Illuminating the List Data Type: A Multilingual Exploration | Total Points: 100

Within the realms of computer science, a list or sequence exemplifies an abstract data type that signifies a specific quantity of ordered values. The uniqueness of this structure lies in its capacity to accommodate duplicate values. Tracing the origins of the list, we find ourselves at the dawn of functional programming with the genesis of the language "List". As we delve into the contemporary landscape of programming, we notice that a vast array of languages not only supports but also embellishes the list data type, thus offering specialized syntax and semantics.

In this assignment, we invite you to embark on a journey across seven diverse programming languages: Dart, Go (Golang), JavaScript, Lua, Python, Ruby, and Rust. Through this exploration, you will uncover how to perform the following operations:

1. Declaration or creation of an empty list
2. Initialization of a list with specific values
3. Verification of a list's emptiness
4. Addition of a new element to a list
5. Inspection of a list for the presence of a particular element
6. Deletion of a specific element from a list
7. Retrieval of the head and tail of a list
8. Printing of all elements within a list

During your venture, you may opt to utilize online compilers or interpreters. As a culmination of your efforts, you are to create a unique source code file for each language, demonstrating and testing each operation sequentially. Your commitment to academic integrity is of the utmost importance; any derivative of online examples will not be accepted.

Structure your efforts and findings into a comprehensive report, which should encompass the following sections:

* **Part A - Operations in each language (45 points):** For each operation within each language, provide the sample code segments alongside the resulting output. Be sure to elaborate on the functionality of your example and interpret the generated output, if any.
* **Part B - Evaluation (10 points):** Discuss your personal assessment of the languages' readability and writability of list operations. Share your insights regarding the most apt language for list operations.
* **Part C - Learning strategy (10 points):** Elucidate your personalized approach towards task completion, elucidating the tools, resources, and experimental methods employed. Mention any instances of personal communication and cite the URLs of the online compilers or interpreters used.
* **Part D - Sample Codes (35 points):** Ensure that all code files are free from compilation errors and function as expected.

**Submission Guidelines:**

Please submit your assignment as a singular .zip or .rar file containing the following:

* A single .pdf file named `ID_lastname_name_report.pdf` for the Report (Parts A, B, C)
* A folder titled `Codes` for Part D, containing:
    * Dart code file named `ID_lastname_name.dart` 
    * Go code file named `ID_lastname_name.go` 
    * JavaScript code file named `ID_lastname_name.html` 
    * Lua code file named `ID_lastname_name.lua` 
    * Python code file named `ID_lastname_name.py` 
    * Ruby code file named `ID_lastname_name.rb` 
    * Rust code file named `ID_lastname_name.rs` 

All files must be uploaded to Moodle before the designated deadline.

**Essential Points:**

* Late submissions are acceptable but will incur a deduction of 10 points per day.
* While internet tutorials can serve as valuable references, refrain from directly replicating their content. A breach of this rule could result in overlapping submissions and subsequent disciplinary actions.
* Collaboration on this assignment is not permissible.
