Subprogram Parameters in Dart, Go, Javascript, Lua, Python, Ruby, and Rust

In this homework assignment, you will investigate some design isuues related to parameters of subprograms, in seven different programming languages. The programming languages are Dart, Go (Golang), Javascript, Lua, Python, Ruby, and Rust. You will investigate how the following design issues are resolved in these programming languages:

    Are formal and actial parameters type checked?
    Are keyword (named) parameters supported?
    Are default paremeters supported?
    What are the paremeter passing methods provided?
    Can subprograms be passed as parameters? If so, how is the referencing environment of the passed subprogram bound? 

You can use online compilers/interpreters for this homework.

For each language, prepare a single source code file that exemplifies and tests each operation, in the order given above. Your example programs must be different from the example codes that may be available on the Internet. Be careful to avoid plagiarism!

Organize all of your experiments and their results and put them into a report. The report should include Parts A, B, and C, as explained below:
Part A - Design issues in each language (45 points)
For each language and each design issue, give some sample code segments and the results of their execution. You should explain what your example does, and the output, if generated.
Part B - Evaluation (10 points)
Your evaluation of these languages in terms of readability and writability of list operations. Discuss, in your opinion, which language is the best in terms of subprogram parameters.
Part C - Learning strategy (10 points)
A learning strategy is an individual's approach to completing a task. In this section, discuss, in detail, the material and tools you used, and the experiments you performed. Also talk about personal communication, if you had. Give the URLs of the online compiler/interpreters you used to run your programs.
Part D- Sample Codes (35 points)
The sample code files must compile and run without any errors.

Submission:

A single zip or rar file should be submitted containing the following files with given names:

    A single file for the Report, containing parts A, B, and C: ID_lastname_name_report.pdf (65 Points)
    A folder called, Codes, for Part D. The contents of the folder will be as follows:
        A single file for Dart code: ID_lastname_name.dart (5 points)
        A single file for Go code:ID_lastname_name.go (5 points)
        A single file for Javascript code: ID_lastname_name.html (5 points)
        A single file for Lua code: ID_lastname_name.lua (5 points)
        A single file for Python code: ID_lastname_name.py (5 points)
        A single file for Ruby code: ID_lastname_name.rb (5 points)
        A single file for Rust code: ID_lastname_name.rs (5 points) 

Please upload the zip or rar file you created to Moodle before the due date.

Important Notes:

    Late submissions will be accepted, with 10 points (out of 100) deduction for each extra day.

    You may use the tutorials available on the Internet as a reference but do not derive your example from the contents of the tutorials. If you do so, your programs may be similar to others in the class, which causes a disciplinary investigation.

    Collaboration on the homework is not allowed.
